### Recall
Recall is a mind-numbing memory game that puts your ability to recall spatial information to the test. Every round, 3 mazes will be displayed in quick succession, and you have to remember them all as a random maze will be chosen! If you make one wrong move, you lose! If you take too long, you lose too! In order to win, you have to complete all 3 rounds. 

### Gameplay Demonstration

### Game Instructions
1. Press the START button to begin the game. You will see three maze maps being flashed to you for 10 seconds each, in the following order of colours: red, green and blue. 
2. Commit the mazes to memory! You only have a limited time to do so.
3. Once all three maps have been flashed, the middle two rows of the map will flash the colour of the map that you have to navigate.
4. The game will start with only the starting point (bottom left square) lit up.
5. Navigate the map according to your memory. Press the ARROW keys to move up, down, left or right. A movement to the wrong square results in game over and a red sad face will be displayed on the screen
6. If you give up, press the RESET button to end the game during gameplay.
7. Once you make it to the end, the entire screen will turn green to show you have successfully completed the level!
8. Press START to move on to the next level. There are 3 levels with increasing difficulty whereby the time to memorise the map decreases after each level.
9. A green smiley face will be shown after completing the third level successfully and we have a WINNER!
